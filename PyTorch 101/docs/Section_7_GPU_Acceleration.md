# Section 7: GPU Acceleration in PyTorch

One of PyTorch’s key strengths is its seamless support for **GPU acceleration**, which can drastically speed up model training and inference by leveraging the computational power of GPUs. PyTorch makes it easy to move tensors and models between CPU and GPU with simple and intuitive methods, enabling you to harness the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs.

Let’s dive deeper into how GPU acceleration works in PyTorch, the best practices for utilizing GPUs, and potential performance optimizations.

## 7.1 Why Use GPUs?
GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are highly efficient at performing large-scale numerical operations in parallel, which is particularly useful for deep learning tasks like matrix multiplications, convolutions, and other operations that involve large datasets and high-dimensional tensors.

Key reasons for using GPUs:
- **Parallel Processing**: GPUs have thousands of cores designed for performing many operations simultaneously, making them much faster than CPUs for tasks like neural network training.
- **Efficient Matrix Operations**: Deep learning relies heavily on matrix multiplications, which GPUs are specialized in handling.
- **Large Memory Bandwidth**: GPUs provide high memory bandwidth, which is critical for loading and processing large datasets, images, and models efficiently.

## 7.2 Checking for GPU Availability
Before leveraging a GPU, you need to check if a GPU is available on the machine. PyTorch provides a simple way to check this using `torch.cuda.is_available()`.

Example:
```python
import torch

# Check if a GPU is available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')
    print("GPU is available")
else:
    device = torch.device('cpu')
    print("GPU is not available, using CPU")
```

- **`torch.device`**: A device object represents the hardware device (CPU or GPU) where the tensors and model should be stored.

## 7.3 Moving Tensors to GPU
Once you have verified that a GPU is available, you can move your tensors to the GPU for faster computations. This is done using the `.to()` method or `.cuda()` method.

Example:
```python
# Create a tensor
x = torch.randn(3, 3)

# Move the tensor to GPU
x = x.to(device)  # Automatically moves to GPU if GPU is available

# Alternatively, you can use .cuda() directly
x = x.cuda()
```

When you move a tensor to a GPU, PyTorch automatically allocates memory on the GPU and performs all subsequent operations on that device. Moving tensors back to the CPU can be done using `.cpu()`.

Example:
```python
# Move tensor back to CPU
x_cpu = x.cpu()
```

**Important note**: All tensors and models involved in an operation must be on the **same device** (either all on CPU or all on GPU). You cannot perform operations between tensors that are on different devices.

## 7.4 Moving Models to GPU
In addition to tensors, entire models (i.e., instances of `nn.Module`) can be moved to the GPU for accelerated training and inference. You simply need to move the model to the GPU using `.to(device)`.

Example:
```python
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 50)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)

# Instantiate the model
model = SimpleNN()

# Move the model to GPU
model = model.to(device)
```

Now, all the operations inside the `forward()` method will run on the GPU, as the model’s parameters (weights, biases) are stored in GPU memory.

## 7.5 Training Models on GPU
To train a model on a GPU, you need to:
1. Move the model to the GPU.
2. Move the input data and target labels to the GPU.
3. Ensure that all tensors and operations during training are performed on the same device (GPU).

### Example of a full training loop with GPU acceleration:
```python
# Define model, optimizer, and loss function
model = SimpleNN().to(device)  # Move model to GPU
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop
for data, target in data_loader:
    data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)  # Move input data and target to GPU
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Zero the gradients
    output = model(data)   # Forward pass (on GPU)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)  # Compute loss (on GPU)
    loss.backward()  # Backward pass (compute gradients on GPU)
    optimizer.step()  # Update model parameters (on GPU)
```

In this example:

- Both the model and the data are moved to the GPU using .to(device).
- All the operations during forward and backward passes are executed on the GPU, which leads to significant speed improvements for large models and datasets.

## 7.6 Multi-GPU Training
PyTorch also supports **multi-GPU training**, allowing you to train models across multiple GPUs to further accelerate training. You can use `torch.nn.DataParallel` or `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` to distribute the model and computations across multiple GPUs.

### DataParallel
`DataParallel` is a simple way to parallelize the model across multiple GPUs. It splits the input data across GPUs and merges the results.

Example:
```python
# Wrap the model in DataParallel to use multiple GPUs
model = nn.DataParallel(model)

# Move the model to GPU (it will automatically use all available GPUs)
model = model.to(device)
```

With `DataParallel`, PyTorch will automatically split the input batch across the available GPUs, perform parallel computations on each GPU, and combine the results.

### DistributedDataParallel (DDP)

`DistributedDataParallel (DDP)` is a more efficient method for distributed training, often preferred for training very large models across multiple GPUs or even multiple machines.

## 7.7 Best Practices for GPU Utilization
1. **Move Tensors/Models to GPU Before Operations**: Always move the tensors and models to the GPU before performing any operations on them. If a tensor is on the CPU, performing operations on it using a model on the GPU will raise an error.

2. **Avoid Moving Data Back to CPU Frequently**: Moving data between CPU and GPU can be time-consuming and inefficient. Try to keep the data and computations on the GPU as much as possible during training or inference.

3. **Use `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()`**: You can check the amount of memory allocated on the GPU using:
   ```python
   print(torch.cuda.memory_allocated(device))
   ```

    This can help you debug memory overflow errors, which are common when working with large models and datasets on limited GPU memory.

4. **Use `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`**: You can free up unused GPU memory by calling:
   ```python
   torch.cuda.empty_cache()
   ```

   This can be helpful when you are trying to release memory after a large computation, although it is generally managed automatically by PyTorch.

5. **Pin Memory for DataLoader**: When using `DataLoader`, enabling `pin_memory=True` can speed up data transfer from CPU to GPU.
   ```python
   data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True, pin_memory=True)
   ```

6. **Use `torch.cuda.amp` (Automatic Mixed Precision)**: To further optimize memory usage and computation speed on GPUs, you can use **mixed precision** training.
   ```python
   scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

   for data, target in data_loader:
       data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)

       optimizer.zero_grad()

       with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
           output = model(data)
           loss = loss_fn(output, target)

       scaler.scale(loss).backward()
       scaler.step(optimizer)
       scaler.update()
   ```

## 7.8 Benchmarking and Profiling GPU Performance

PyTorch provides tools for profiling and benchmarking to help optimize GPU usage.

1. **CUDA Benchmarking**: You can enable benchmarking using:
    ```python
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
    ```
    This allows PyTorch to find the most efficient convolution algorithms based on your model’s structure and input size.

2. **CUDA Synchronization**: For accurate timing measurements on GPUs, you can use:
    ```python
    torch.cuda.synchronize()
    ```
    This ensures that all GPU computations are finished before recording the time.

3. **Profiler**: PyTorch has a built-in profiler to measure the time and memory usage of GPU operations: 
    ```python
    import torch.autograd.profiler as profiler

    with profiler.profile(use_cuda=True) as prof:
        output = model(input)
    print(prof)
    ```

## Conclusion for Section 7
GPU acceleration is one of PyTorch’s greatest strengths, enabling faster training and inference by harnessing the parallel processing power of GPUs. By moving models and data to the GPU and keeping all computations on the same device, you can significantly speed up the training process. Multi-GPU support further extends these capabilities for larger models and datasets, allowing scalable training. Understanding best practices and how to leverage PyTorch’s GPU features effectively is key to optimizing model performance.
